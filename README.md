- 👋 Hi, I’m Maurice Taylor (@simcodes-rust).
- 👀 This project is for those interested in modern software development of a 21st century educational product with an emphasis on MODERN software development.
- 🌱 Togehter we are currently learning the Rust programming language and it's modern eco-system for software development in direct relation to my PostgreSQL database backend knowledge of 20 years.
- 💞️ Together we can collaborate on the SIMCODES Academic Database Project as an open-source project used to teach Rust and software development to help releave the shortage of software developers who use the INCREASINGLY popular Rust systems programming language. Popular for a reason!

- Currently the software repository (beyond this screen) is open for those who display a sincere desire to contribute. Those who the author of this project has gotten to know personally. Later, after the project has matured, we will open it up to everyone. As has been said, the source code will be used in video lectures to teach the Rust programming language. Rust is a relatively new programming lanauge (11.5 years as of this writing), but there is a wide interest in the language for a reason. See the Facebook content page link above for further organized information on Rust and some insights on where we want to go with this project.
