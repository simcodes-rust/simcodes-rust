- 👋 Hi, I’m @simcodes-rust
- 👀 I’m interested in modern software development of a 21st century educational product with an emphasis on MODERN software development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Rust programming language and it's modern eco-system for software development in direct relation to my PostgreSQL database backend knowledge
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the SIMCODES Academic Database Project as an open-source project used to teach Rust and software development to help releave the shortage of software developers who use the INCREASINGLY popular Rust systems programming language. Popular for a reason!
